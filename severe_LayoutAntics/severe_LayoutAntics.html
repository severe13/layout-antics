      <h3>What is Ride?</h3>
      <p>Ride is a rewards network that gives you points for travel. You can travel by car, bus, train, bike, subway, or walking! Just remember flight miles do not count! When you have Ride with you (installed on your phone), the app will record the number of miles you travel. Then, Ride automatically converts your miles into Ride points. Ride points are the currency of the Ride Rewards Program. They are redeemable for real rewards through Ride, such as gift cards to companies like Amazon, Dunkn Doughnuts, Regal, Home Depot, andy many more! Rewards to change based on availablity.</p>

      <h3>How do I earn Ride points?</h3>
      <p>Here are some ways to earn points and more!</p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li>First, install Ride on your iPhone (Yes, Sorry iPhone only). Then, the next time you go anywhere, take your phone (and Ride) with you. Ride will keep a running total of how many miles you travel and convert them into Ride points. Please remember, flight miles are against out Terms and Conditions. Please make sure you force quit the app before air travel. Rewards can be denied if we see flight activity.You are awarded approximately 1-3 points per mile depending on a range of factors, including the accuracy of the location data we receive, whether that data is received from a cellular network or GPS network, and the specific settings on your phone. If you want to learn more about location services and the settings on your phone, Apple has a very good explanation on this page.</li>

        <li><strong>Want more points?

      <h3>Support Quesions!</h3>
      <p>Here are some of our most common support questions:</p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li><strong>Why are my points not updating? </strong> Points can take up to 24 hours to credit to your account.
        Are you using iOS7 or iOS8? Please make sure you have your location services enabled for Ride and you are updated to the current version of Ride. Make sure Background Refresh is enabled for Ride. This was new to iOS7 and causing a lot of location service apps to not work properly. It is also used in iOS8.<br>
        General>Settings>Background Refresh>ON.<br>
        <br>
        Please DO NOT Force quit the app. If you do please make sure you start Ride up again or it will not count milage or points. Only Force Quit when you are flying. Please keep in mind the iTouch and iPad are not currently supported by Ride.
        If your points balance still hasn’t updated, please send an email to support. </li>

        <li><strong>Why do I need a Facebook account? </strong> We ask for Facebook permissions mainly for authentication purposes. When you redeem a reward, we use Facebook permissions to verify that you are the owner of the Ride account, and we also use Facebook to deliver Ride Rewards. While you can earn points with Ride without connecting to Facebook, there is currently no other way to log in and redeem rewards. We use Facebook as an integral part of our verification process whenever you redeem a reward. This allows us to ensure that your rewards go to you, and only you. For this reason, we ask that you use your real Facebook account and not a duplicate. Can't log in? You should be able to log in to Facebook. Please make sure you are updated to the current version of Ride. If you can’t log in, you are most likely either experiencing a bug (and should contact support), outside of the U.S., or under 18 years of age. If you are outside the U.S. or under 18, please read the Terms and Conditions, which state that you must be 18 years or older and that Ride is unable to support international users at this time.</li>

        <li><strong>I updated my phone and my points are gone!</strong> Don’t panic. You most likely disconnected from your Ride account. Disconnect and re-connect to Facebook within the app (make sure it is the same Facebook you started Ride with), then refresh your points total by going to the rewards screen and then switching back to the odometer. If that doesn’t work, please contact support and let them know which of the above steps you have already taken.</li>

        <li><strong>Why was my redemption denied?</strong> If your redemption has been denied, we either saw suspicious activity ( jailbroken phones or spoofing), airline miles being accumulated, or we see over user activity. Meaning, employed in or engaged in professional transit (including but without limitation bus drivers, cab drivers, semi-truck drivers, delivery drivers, airline pilots, airline stewardesses and stewards, train engineers, etc.).<br>
        Please remember that as a part of our Terms and Conditions, points accumulated by any of the actions mentioned do not count towards points in your account.  We take 1-2 business days to approve or deny your redemption because we have to make sure that users are complying with our Terms and Conditions. Please keep in mind when you redeem a gift card, you are agreeing to our Terms and Conditions and points cannot be credited back to the account because the points accumulated were against our Terms and Conditions. If you have further questions, please contact support.</li>
      </ul>
